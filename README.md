# Testing GitHub workflows 🚧

This repository is for testing GitHub workflows. That means this repository is filled with dummy `pull requests` and `issues`.

### Workflows

#### pull_requests.yml

Was suppose to protect repositories during Hacktoberfest by closing PR's and marking them as invalid incase of an empty `body`, but due to GitHub restrictions on forks. This workflow isn't working as it's intended. 😔
